Objective: We learn about the 2 truth one lie of my teamamtes, and learn about how to do tasking using context map and do some hands on exercise. Also,
we learn about some git technic on how to do commit naming
R: Interesting
I: I think the most meaningful aspect is knowing how to draw the context graph and thinking in a objective way. Also learning how to do a stand up helps me a lot as my team always ned to do daily stand up meetings.
D: I think I will apply the important point of stand up in my future meetings and avoid spending too much time on it.I will also try to create meaningful commit message and also think of the context graph first before coding.
